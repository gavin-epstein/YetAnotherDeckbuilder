#zoom and tooltips on cards
#multitile units should be able to move through themselves
#Consumed tile should be telegraphed

Ehh i think it's fine
    tile backgrounds coords based on map coords not screencoords
    or add a viewport for the map, so that they change on shift but not scroll

title screen warnings for save not found, save will be erased


multitile entities spawning is fucked. They arent ending up on the tiles
?multitile enities mouseover
multitile dying

sounds
    Attack for each damage type - multiple options would be good
        ?default
        ?slash
        ?stab
        ?crush
        ?fire
    #Gain Block
